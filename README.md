# thermo_ROI
Open and process ROIs from thermographic images

1) Convert csv files in Matlab:
(only if you have images with headers and with commas as decimal separators)
* Open convertFiles.m on Matlab and set the folder with the images as Current Folder
* Run, and the files will not be replaced, but duplicated with a "_" in front of the name

2) Extract ROI on python:

* Open main.py in Python
* Replace "mypath" variable with the folder path
* Modifications may be necessary depending on the application
